/* ToDo
-------
Check Demo of collaborative chat
A Processor that is restarted does not rejoin the activeTasks ?
tasktype cannot configure fsm: { useMachine: true} ?
The stepper sets the state to exit - it should not act directly on the state, use task.input
  Review all Tasks and ensure not accessing internals of children
TaskChat name must be "start" ? 
Need to clean up when tasks stop e.g nodejs activeTaskFsm
Add the user object only if it has changed
  If the task is collaborative then the user should be associated with task.processor?
    Then do not need to send all the time


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_J._Grosz
How can we modify the service configurations? 
  Would need to run a Task that can do that on the processor
    Should be possible to base it on TaskSystemConfig
      TaskServiceConfig
      Would need to put the service config into Redis
        Move serviceTypes into configdata.mjs
          Do this after consolidating hub+processor into a node
Switch from hub/processor to node
  Add support for multiple hubs
    Will allow fro bridge between TF & MTF
  Tasks dedicated to processor is another reason to have a single "node"
  Move to task.node ?
  One the hub we copy task.node into task.processors then setup task.node
Menu should not have shared.tasksConfigTree on React
  Could store processor specific info in task.processor
    But it is using task.shared
    Masking could fix this
Why did chatGPT not like the value field of function being an object but could use string  -I guess because we returned a string for id?
Could have an option on CEP as to whether we need to await or not
  Would allow for concurrent processing for most CEP
  Those that can be run concurrently might be better in a particular class of processor
Move commandArgs.syncTask into task ?
  Similar to partial.
Need to think more about locks for tasks initiated on hub (start/update/error)
How should we deal with a change to tasktype for activeTasks ?
Verbosity level for debug
TaskSystemDebug
  Modifies a task by sending sync
    Can also match on id
    Can it use a try catch and eval the debug filter - so no need to reload?
    The util.debugTask function can be modifed in the browser/server by the Task ?
      Need a JS editor in the task
Move familyTree CEP from TaskTest_async into dedicated TaskSystem
  Should familyTree be available in shared ?
      Do we install CEP for each family?
        If the init task does not have shared ? Update on the familyTree task instance
          Any task can launh a familyTree task and it should build the tree then maintain it
            Can we assert that a shared variable is read only? 
              Owned by an instance
  We need another way of managing the familyTree - TaskFamilyTree
  familyId should be in meta?
Avoid using the "start" task name/id as meaningful
TaskSystemConfigTasks_async copy feature in tree
    Request/response could be for a service while input/output is for a taskFunctions
      Maybe input/output is sequential while request/response can be queued
        Seems like a good use case to create the request/response queue
    Refactor SystemTasksConfigEditor so it uses SystemTasksConfig
Task to inspect the Task Node
  Access to KeyV
    Shared can include a list of the available Nodes
    Selecting Node would populate the list of available KeyV
    Selecting KeyV will open table
      Also provide stats
    Base it on TaskSystemLogViewer
      Add dropdown to choose the KeyV store
        Does KeyV provide any features?
    use Keyv.options API to get the namespace and type of store
  Redis search
    To use these features, you must install two modules: RedisJSON and RediSearch. Redis Stack automatically includes both modules.
    https://github.com/redis/node-redis/tree/master/packages/search
  Serious problem is that keyv will not know how to make use of RedisJSON ?
    Could extend https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/main/packages/redis with https://github.com/schulzf/ioredis-rejson
    https://github.com/redis/ioredis/blob/main/examples/module.js can use any Redis command
      https://joeywhelan.blogspot.com/2022/10/redisearch-ioredis-client-lib.html demo
      https://github.com/Redislabs-Solution-Architects/ioredis-search/tree/main code of demo
  To begin with we could avoid providing search
    Allow for lookup, provide stats
In the coprocessing of task if we remove null then we lose the delete
  If we don't remove null then coprocessing task need to deal with null (e.g. when looping over object keys)
  Processor could detect null keys and create a "delete" object
How can we detect errors in the console?
  window.onerror
  window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection'
  Can also override console.log console.error (before they are used)
    Could create a window.log that meta can access as a feature of the React Processor
Could configure CEP to run during or after coprocessing
Registering could/should be a task
  use the processorId as an instanceId
How do we drive the input of another task without UI ?
  New command 
    "input" which drives local task
      Use this instead of sync in TaskSystemTasksConfigEditor
      How to implement on React? 
        Through globalContext ? 
          A taskContext with a selector based on instanceId
Create a TaskSystemContainer on React that will do most of what Taskflows.js does
  Then we can configure it
  Should not have a familyId ? (allowing children to create their own)
  Taskflows.js should be a task then would have task.user available and could remove globalState.user

Redis  
  A secondary index maps each attribute to a set of primary keys that have that attribute. 
  In Redis, you need to create a Redis Search index on your data before you can query it.
  Write-behind caching
  @keyv/tiered could offer JSON search via MongoDB ?
PM2 for process management
  Ecosystem File
  pm2 startup (on boot ?)
  Just use to run two instance of RxJS for now.
Collaborate will keep info in the caches and db. How can we clear out a specific familyId ?
  Could prefix the family ID for collaboration with a unique hub ID
    Could use hub Id if it were not stored
      A Task ? But Task Function does not have access. 
        Delete command with argument for familyId 
Point to private extensions of config rather than redirecting the entire config directory
Major features to be implemented before refactoring
  Debug support per Task
    How to combine debug logging with task.meta.debug ?
    Conditional breakpoints in VSCode works well
    Explore more about import debug from "debug"; 
  TaskCreateTask
    Identify closest existing task
      Chat interaction
        Validation/ESlint
          Testing
    Dynamic Task as per dynamic config
      Needs to modify tasktypes (another Task)
  Also need to create new servicetypes but that is on the nodejs processor
Extend testing
  Batch testing
    TaskCron to regularly check things
    TaskGit to get local status of repo
  https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/
  How to batch tests?
    TaskSystemBatch that would modify TaskTest config fsm on the fly
    Could build an array of FSM then run through that.
One approach to code review:
  1) Create a new github repo that has an empty master branch
  2) Archive the code to be reviewed: git archive --format=tar --output=../empty-repo/repo.tar HEAD
  3) Create a new branch in the empty repo: git checkout -b review-branch
  4) Untar the archive in the empty repo: tar -xvf repo.tar
  5) Add the files and push: git add .;git push --set-upstream origin review-branch
  6) Open a PR on github so any file can be reviewed
  The above should be doable inside a single repo - create branch delete everything, create another branch from that and add everything at once
Selecting menu item second time could restart the task
  decide what to do within the task e.g. processor.command.restart
  At the moment we just start a new task
Add xstate-viz server path on proxy and choose port
Generic TaskEdit that would allow for presentation/editing of any task in the familyId
  Could configure to limit access to specific fields
    Ideally could us schema but could also guess at the type (user could override)
  Need a submit button for JSON Editor to update the task - also run validation first

How to report pass/fail ?
  Dev header with info 
Deleting of tasks for CEP

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared-nothing_architecture
  One alternative architecture is shared everything
Task that monitors a collaborative discussion and via another route allows interaction with any one of the persona
  Requires making a temporary copy of the task - could have it as a child then create a holder and copy the relevant data across
  Does not require extending the server ?
    Security flaw for now - a user can "fake" another task (but need the familyId)
messagesStyle http input must be diff ?
Notion of an input pipeline and output pipeline, managed by Processor
  task.config.inputPipeline = [...]
  task.config.outputPipeline = [...]
  task.config.pipeline - then task is called for both input and output
    Need to implement a queue on the task request/response ? The are no longer internal requests
    A new "request" and "response" command then the Processor can implement a queue (provide next request after previous response)
  In React the output bypasses the task but we could do something similar whereby the HoC passes the component output through the output pipeline. Could replace output.
task.id -> task.config.id
  Then task.id could replace task.instanceId
Do we want to be able to configure CEP functionality?
  The Task provides state machine not CEP.
  Arguments allow for dynamic CEP function, if the CEP evals e.g., vm2, Jailed, Secure ECMAScript, Function(), AST limiting
    New command "execute" that would just pull active task out of storage
      CEP decides if the Task SM needs to be run
      The Update on the Hub could decide whether to bring the task back to life
        How can this be done on React ?
          Behavior in the case when an init task is received but there is no parent on the processor
    See Processor README.md for mathjs etc
Dynamic task configuration
  Maybe this does not require any new functionality on the hub - just copy from one child task to another
    TaskInherit would be a CEP that catches the start of a task and reconfigures it on the coprocessor before it is launched?
  Raises issues for masking - could just not mask the things we want to be able to modify
    Then allow for copying rather than creating
RxJS V7 Processor
  Experiment with CEP that starts a task e.g. TaskPopup (or maybe an option to TaskShowInstruction)
A scheduler should be able to provide a cron like feature
  TaskCron
    Or can any task do this just by waiting ?
    Seems nice to be able to have  CEP that "wakes" up
    Maybe a JS library can help e.g. an array of cron times
    Maintain an array of jobs and calculate the wait time in a loop for the next wakeup
  TaskCount
    Like a cron but based on the number of interactions
      When task entry X reaches Y then send request A to task B
After experimenting with RxJS processor we may want to use a similar approach in React Processor
  Run RxJS in on the Shared Worker
    Eventually use this instead of lifting state
nextTaskTemplate which allows for re-ordering flow
  replaced with XState? Could pull out this functionality? (the exercises use it I think)
Add schemas for task.config.local as per tasktypes.mjs and use this to check tasks in configdata
  Schema for tasktype to document options
The React Processor provides a parent-child relationship for interaction. How to provide this on Node JS Processor?
  Should enforce the use of taskUpdate instead of driving children
    Could remove the idea of a child task from React
Should the servicetype be copied into task.config.services?
  The servicetype is on the Processor while config is on the Hub
Should the Processor also implement rate limiting?
Ability to select a service type. This is a very simple task?
  Could allow for various ways of selecting. 
If a task is no longer in an environment then shut it down
  Would require something like a delete command sent to processors
Need to run CEP on local processor to get real-time behavior
  No rush to implement this
The cache is not going to allow a conversation if it matches and the key is not including the messages
In templating maybe we should support "task." syntax
Tests will allow for better code generation
Requests from other tasks via: task.processor.task.request
  See notes
If we have a TaskFilter this raises the question of how to configure/program it.
  Detects an event and passes information.
    Filter -> action
      Action is to update another task ?
        How to inform another task

Standard for asynchronous APIs 
  https://www.asyncapi.com/ (standard)
Demo of collaborative chat would be good.
  In default config assign a random user label so we can demo multiparty chat
Add function to remove last paragraph
  Interesting to explore how that might be generalized
Privacy - should be implemented on the Hub
  Hub and Processors secure communication, then identification is managed on the hub.
Embedding functions in the template?
  Where/how to manage variables? 
    Lookup only the required tasks not the whole thread.
  What about use across languages?
    Logic-less might be better: Handlebars
Harmonise the Task Processor
  The infrastructure provided by the Task Processor should perform the updates to the Task object as this allows for services to be provided upon value changes.
  In React withTask HOC and useTask state.
  A common JS module for managing the Task object. 
    What is generic to Task Processors and what is custom?
      React Processor adds the concept of address/location.
If we prefix a T on Task parameters it would be easier to update with search & replace
  Better to use full path even in JXS e.g. task.name not name e.g in taskflows and stepper
How can we specify the UI in a more compact/easy way?

  A hook-based solution with minimal boilerplate: React Hook Form
How to have a task deal with compound react components
  config: list of components (with names) for display&input, mapping inputs to request.name.inputs
  config: list of components (with names) for display, mapping to response.name.outputs (if it is displaying a return)
  Basic pattern is: display -> input -> display -> input (can choose to use a subset)
  Could associate components with state of the Task ?
         * -> list of components that are active all the time
    state1 -> list of active components
    state2 -> list of active components
Consider how we would add a radio select box to a component
  Add the component and a config option to display or not
  Dynamic mapping of config to the input
  Standard way of mapping this to response. Make these available as variable in next Task (or state?)
  Could have an inject command from Hub
    Modify the parent task.meta.children and modify the child task.parent etc. then 
      Modify parent should then start new child that can be configured to start previous child as its child
Option to IGNORE config options from parents
  Avoids inheriting info that is not used.
  Can just set to null to achieve this?

  Scrolling to view suggested_prompts in TaskChat
  chatContainermaxHeight in TaskConversation scrolling

  Refactoring
  -----------
  children -> meta.children (used for tree)
  Align usage of utils

  Features
  --------
    High Priority
    -------------
    Possible next feature: remembering the system messages for Vierge
    Simplify multiple configuration files for the NodeJS Task Processor
    Use a route for configuring: user, session, taskflow, task
    Create a new route for the Client side user defaults. Manage in a global state. Send on all requests.
    Msgs could be loaded from the NodeJS Task Processor. Similar to stepper - both have history.
    Utility filters e.g. remove outer quotes, an ordered list (use a standard templating library - ejs)
    When user interacts reset the counter to try to establish websocket on client

    Low Priority
    ------------
    Show websocket connection status with traffic light icon
    Could be valuable to communicate with an instance on a subset of environments
    Ability to force a task to restart (Hub command?) Could be a forget button.
      A new conversation button once we have the session restoring.
    Modify the partial text update so it is incremental. This will better allow for text selection.
      Something like react-markdown with the gfm plugin for things like tables but you will need to do some extra work to get the code blocks styled exactly how you are wanting
    Time in oneFamily messages should be aligned with browser timezone (needs to be filled in by Hub?)
    Logout option (could just be a route)
    Sending diff to Hub from Processor during update
    JWT connection between Task Hub and Processors (currently rely on Cloudflare)
    Move to TypeScript
    Way for tasks to register websocket event handlers
    Multiple language support 'i18next-http-middleware for NodeJS Task Processor and react-i18next for React Task Processor
    Defensive programming + logging
    Websocket for tasks (so NodeJS Task Processor can drive) just send incremental info for the task
    Replace globalState with Redux
    When sending task instance only send diff (React Task Processor keeps NodeJS Task Processor copy, NodeJS Task Processor keeps React Task Processor copy)
    Add task type validation to websocket
    Only display menu option if leaf is a real task
    Check '.' is not used in keys or it breaks setNestedProperties (test if the JSON schema is now doing this)

Notes/Idea
-----
  Asking the service to output in a format that would pass a test might be a good way of constraining prompts
    e.g. provide Python/JS code that the output should pass (e.g. a single word)
  How to interface with other apps with output from T@skFlow ?
    Windows accessibility APIs, such as UI Automation or MSAA (Microsoft Active Accessibility)
  Things will be integrated into existing clients (e.g. email)
  Educate the users to make use of the system
  Writing the Hub and a generic Porcessor in Rust
  No easy way to do this with React in the functional style
    In the future we could build components on the fly
  Could have a task.family entry which allows for broadcast and config
  Hub could look after converting "family" command into instance command
  Task search feature could be a micro-service provided by the Hub?
    For example user can search personal history
  Tools T@skFLow could leverage:
    https://github.com/PrefectHQ/marvin 
      a batteries-included library for building AI-powered software. 
      Marvin's job is to integrate AI directly into your codebase by making it look and feel like any other function.
  Swagger for the API ?
  Refactoring with jscodeshift, see example in config repository
  Should a task that requests to start a Task also be updated by the Hub?
  A GraphQL based API into the Task family may be a useful abstraction that can be offloaded to a Co-Processor
  Stately Studio
    We will be building visual tooling for not just managing actor logic (state machines & statecharts) but also visualization of entire actor systems (architecture diagrams) and the communication between actors (sequence diagrams).

Architecture
------------
  How to manage multiple interfaces for a Task
      Sub-directory with sub-components and a style or theme
  Tasks can be thought of as something like plugins, maybe there are patterns in that sort of software
      Implies catalog, installation, activation, configuration, updates, permissions, resource limits
      Requires a documented API, the basic principles at the moment:
          Use the Task object to pass information
          Manage task specific storage (e.g. files, user specific data) independently of the NodeJS Task Processor Stores
  User defaults, taskflow defaults etc can be tasks
  Could add middleware that tasks can use to modify input/output (similar to LangChain)
    Currently in the TaskFunction but should be easy to factor out when that makes sense
      Could allow for a chain of SubTasks/Services/CEP
  How to call out to Python from the Task function (better to create a Python Task and have the NodeJS Task Processor provide the environment?)
    "child process execution" with child_process library
    RabbitMQ for message passing good for a local service but do we need high speed, probably not.
    REST API would allow for remote etc, maybe better
    AMQP or MQTT would be more scalable.
  Keep server on nodejs processor - yes but for debug/admin/metrics etc
    Performance, utilization etc, a Processor Object for this (instead of Task)
    The debug features can be shared between processors e.g. just connect to keyv with activeTasks
  Re-architect the react Processor to make use of the Service Worker API
    Should have React Hub
    Progressive Web Apps https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/
    ServiceWorker will intercept any HTTP request from a client except WebSocket upgrade requests
    Workbox is built into Create React App (CRA) with a default configuration that precaches all the static assets.
      "react-scripts": "5.0.1"
    Redux State Sync might provide many of these benefits
      Have one tab that is "master" and others as slaves that pass requests to master.
      https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-to-sync-a-redux-store-across-browser-tabs/
      This is a different architecture in that all tabs communicate with the server and Redux is synchronized
    Could detect when more than one tab is open then route websocket from one master tab to shared worker then on to slave tabs
      https://github.com/pubkey/broadcast-channel seems good - it provides LeaderElection
      Basically the leader broadcasts what it receives on websocket and forwards what it received on the channel
        The websocket context just needs to decide which to use (depending on whether it is the leader)
        It seems OK to let the HTTP requests go through, eventaully the session could be managed by the Processor
          Then just use the thread to allow different tabs to have the same task
  Ideally we want the same code for Task storage on Hub/React/NodeJs
    https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/issues/868 V5 is intended to add browser support, also metadata
  https://react.minchat.io/ is one option for chat components

Issues
------
  Tasks run with full NodeJS Task Processor rights. They should be sandboxed on the NodeJS Task Processor.
    TaskFunction could run in a docker container
    Each TaskFunction could be a user on Linux
        User could run in a restricted environment e.g. firejail, bubblewrap
        Difficult to stop information being shared across tasks
        Also separate by session
        How to control what information a Task can request from other tasks
          Currently limited to thread
          Should not be able to go "up" the Task hierarchy (only explore current branch)
          Can only read outputs
  Administation/monitoring of T@skFlow, could ping a service that alerts to problems

Comparison with similar systems
----------------------------
  LangChain - a framework for developing applications powered by language models.
    An abstraction above JS and Python
    Standard interface to models (could reuse this)
    service output parsing sytem (could reuse this from TaskFunction)
    Provides stores for custom data e.g. text splitter
    The taskflow in T@skFlow is like an Agent in LangChain
  GPT-Index
    Should leverage this
  Open-AI Plugins
    This is LLM centric and will allow something similar
  Auto-GPT
    https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT
    This might be the close but their focus on autonomy is quite different

Test Plan
---------
Prefill tasks so we can work on a specifc part of the sequence.
If we stub the services and use a test task for monitoring behavior in the browser then we could have system tests.
Need to look more into testing React apps
Testing should be a task
